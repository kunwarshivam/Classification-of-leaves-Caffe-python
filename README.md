Install opencv, caffe, lmdb..

Model trained on MalayaKew Dataset: http://www.cs-chan.com/downloads_MKLeaf_dataset.html 

CaffeNet- Pretrained: http://dl.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/bvlc_reference_caffenet.caffemodel

Snapshot taken at 2500 iteration. 

Since the number of images in the dataset were not enough for me, I wrote a python script: *rotate.py* 
Use it to generate more images by rotating all the images. 

Good Luck!
